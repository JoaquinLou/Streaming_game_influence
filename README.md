# Streaming game influence - Regression
## Primary goals
This project will seek a relationship between the leading streaming platform Twitch and the leading PC gaming platform, Steam. We will use data extracted from Kaggle due to the opacity of the companies to share metrics. The datasets are these:
- Steam data: https://www.kaggle.com/michau96/popularity-of-games-on-steam
- Twitch data: https://www.kaggle.com/rankirsh/evolution-of-top-games-on-twitch

We will read, process, visualize and create a machine learning model to predict the expected number of players based on users viewing a category on Twitch.

## Methodology:
1. Read csv
2. Clean data
3. Display and analyze data using, corrleations plots, line plots, scatter plots, ... in python.
4. Analyze data and variables on Tableau
4. Build and compare different regression models in order to predict other variables.
5. Build a front end to display the conclusions

## Conclusions
It has been demonstrated that the impact of covid-19 on this sector has been significant but in a positive way. The confinements and therefore, the need for entertainment in our homes, has made these two companies benefit to a greater and lesser extent.
