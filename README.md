# Streaming game influence - Regression
## Primary goals
This project will seek a relationship between the leading streaming platform Twitch and the leading PC gaming platform, Steam. We will use data extracted from Kaggle due to the opacity of the companies to share metrics. The datasets are these:
- Steam data: https://www.kaggle.com/michau96/popularity-of-games-on-steam
- Twitch data: https://www.kaggle.com/rankirsh/evolution-of-top-games-on-twitch

We will read, process, visualize and create a machine learning model to predict the expected number of players based on users viewing a category on Twitch.

## How can you run the project?
Two options:
- You can run the Jupyter Notebooks in order. There are 3 parts:
-  1-Steam data cleaning and visualization -> Steam data processing and visualization
-  2-Twitch data cleaning and analysis -> Twitch data processing and visualization
-  3-Data merge & Prediction -> Merge of data, ML Train & Test and model evaluation

## Conclusions
It has been demonstrated that the impact of covid-19 on this sector has been significant but in a positive way. The confinements and therefore, the need for entertainment in our homes, has made these two companies benefit to a greater and lesser extent.

## Next steps
It would be necessary to continue collecting data because we have several factors that affect the project in order to complete it:

- Lack of transparency on the part of the companies in the sector. It is understood that, the video games and streaming sector, is a very competitive sector with extensive growth as we have seen in the data, but the provision of more data to exploit would improve the search for new opportunities and niches in the market.
- Impact of external factors: The emergence of covid-19 has changed consumer habits. The trend is very bullish since February 2020 but we will have to wait for more data over several years to see if it holds.
